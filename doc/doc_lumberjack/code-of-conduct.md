### Work hours per week
Minimum expected hours of work per group member a week (8 to 12 hours)

### Communication
Communicate how you are doing, if you are having problems, need help or just anything, just don’t keep it to yourself.

Each one has a clear task
Every member has a clear goal that they have to reach each week.

### Meet the deadlines
Assures that the project workflow moves smoothly.

### Schedule weekly meetups
A good time for face-to-face meetings would be Tuesday after class or Wednesday before class.
Otherwise we could do the online (WhatsApp, "Discord") meetups on the evenings/afternoons of any day in which we are free.

### Give feedback how the others are doing
Honesty is appreciated both good and bad.

### Work together
Share responsibilities and help each other. Each person should be putting about X hours each week.

### Update our gitlab repository frequently
Makes our progress easily trackable.

### Tools 
Android studio, Markdown, PlantUML, Pastebin, Gitlab, YouTube, Photoshop

### Consequences
If a member of the group is unwilling to cooperate and communicate in group activities related to the project,
we will first try to resolve these issues within the group by engaging in conversation about the issue
with the individual in question. If that individual is still not willing to participate after that, 
we will discuss the issue with our teacher Frank Van Doorn. If that fails we will consider removing that person from the group.
